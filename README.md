# jsonequaliser

Checks that two json strings (A and B) are compatible or not. If B has extra fields they will still be seen as compatible.

Check the tests for examples as to how this works.

## Use cases

For help with implementing CDCs.

You can run this against a fake server and the real API you are using to ensure your test code and downstream services produce the JSON you need.
